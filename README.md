<b>This is Newspapper pet project.</b>

Now it's mainly focused on <b>@Newspapper_bot</b> telegram bot.

It allows track your favourite book updates in online mode.
Just start with <b>@Newspapper_bot</b> and add some books to track.

Supported book platforms:
  * author.today
  * litmarket.ru
  * webnovel.com
  
Why those platforms? Because the project maker reads books from those sources :)
